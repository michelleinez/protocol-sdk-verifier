# Protocol Verifier
Web SDK to embed SSI credential verification capabilities in existing applications.

![Build Status](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-sdk-verifier/workflows/build-main/badge.svg)

## Before You Start

This SDK is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate either an Aries agent running locally on your machine, or a cloud agent. If you already have one of these set up, you can skip this section, but if you don't and would still like to try out the platform, keep reading.

An easy option for making the SDK work out of the box is to set up the Kiva Aries backend locally. You'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), but otherwise you should [be able to follow the steps in our `protocol-demo` repo to get an agent running quickly](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-demo#working-with-protocol-using-aries).

## Setting up your config file

This SDK relies on a configuration file (you can read more about why that's the case, and how the file is used, [here](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-sdk-verifier/tree/master/config)), and for convenience's sake we've created a [sample config that you can use to get started right away](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-sdk-verifier/tree/master/config/get_started.json).

There's plenty of stuff you can do to customize your UI using the config, which you can read about [here](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-sdk-verifier/tree/master/config), but here are the important points for getting started.

1. Modify `controllerUrlBase` to use the base URL for whatever endpoint you're using for a Cloud agent. By default, we are using `http://localhost:3014`, because that's the default port that the Kiva cloud agent uses when you're using the backend locally.
2. If you are running a local agent on your machine, you can instead modify the `agent_port` config to point to the localhost port where your agent is running.

## Getting Started

Ok, at last: How do you actually run this?

First step is to install the NPM dependencies, which you can do from the root directory of this repo by running:

```
npm install
```

Once that's done, you can build and serve a development version of the application using the `get_started` config file by running:

```
npm run start
```

If you've ever used the `create-react-apps` NPM package, this should feel pretty familiar.

Please note that, while the `run start` command uses `get_started.json` by default, you can easily change the configuration file you're using by running the following.

```
export CONF_FILE=path/to/your/config.json
```

To create an optimized build package, we recommend you run the following command.

```
npm run createQaBundle
```

To serve the package locally, you can run

```
serve -s build
```

## Tests

This SDK has some pre-written functional tests that you should feel free to use once you have your cloud/local agent spun up and the application running in development mode (as outlined in the previous section).

You can get a more in-depth review of the testing framework [here](https://github.com/kiva/protocol-sdk-verifier/tree/master/test), but the TL;DR version is that we use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html) for testing. The platform is free to use and can be run without creating an account.

To run these tests, simply run:

```
npm run cy:open
```

and then click which test you'd like to run. The Cypress platform should take care of the rest.
